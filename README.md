# React CRUD App with Redux Toolkit, React Router DOM, Formik, Yup, and JSON Server

This is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) React application that leverages various powerful libraries and tools to enhance functionality and user experience. The app includes asynchronous data fetching with Redux Toolkit and async thunk middleware, form handling with Formik and Yup for validation, navigation with React Router DOM, UI components with React Bootstrap, and fake REST API interactions using JSON Server.

# Features

Redux Toolkit: Efficient state management with actions, reducers, and async thunk middleware.
React Router DOM (v6): Navigation and routing with lazy loading for optimized performance.
Formik and Yup: Form handling and validation for a better user experience.
React Bootstrap: Stylish UI components for a modern look and feel.
JSON Server: Simulate a REST API for data interactions during development.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
